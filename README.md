Exploratory Data Analysis on the Iris Dataset
# ðŸŒ¸ Exploratory Data Analysis on the Iris Dataset

Welcome to the EDA Iris Project! This notebook dives into the classic Iris flower dataset to uncover patterns, visualize relationships, and build intuitive insights using Pythonâ€™s data analysis libraries.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset to:
- Understand feature distributions
- Explore relationships between features
- Visualize species-wise trends
- Prepare data for further modeling

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Steps
1. **Data Cleaning:** Checked for nulls, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
2. **Univariate Analysis:** Explored individual features (Sepal & Petal length/width).
3. **Bivariate Analysis:** Visualized pairwise feature relationships with scatter and violin plots.
4. **Species-wise Trends:** Compared the distribution of features across Iris-setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
5. **Correlation Matrix:** Assessed feature correlation to guide future model building.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights
- Petal length and petal width are strong indicators of species.
- Setosa species is clearly separable from the other two.
- Versicolor and Virginica show overlapping traits that could require complex classifiers.

## ðŸ“· Visualizations
All plots and graphs used for EDA are saved under the `images/` directory. Highlights include:
- Histogram distributions
- Scatter plots for feature relationships
- Box and violin plots per species
- Heatmap of correlations

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
To run this project:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open `iris_eda.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or compatible IDE.
3. Run the cells sequentially to explore the dataset.
